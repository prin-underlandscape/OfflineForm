# Offline Form-based GeoJSON compiler

A GeoJSON object is a JSON object containing geo-spatial data. A GeoJSON object has a *type* attribute (or *member*) which is one of *Feature*, *FeatureCollection*, or one of the geometries *Point*, *MultiPoint*, *LineString*, *MultiLineString*, *Polygon*, *MultiPolygon*, and *GeometryCollection*. The *Off.html* tool manipulates an object containing a *FeatureCollection*.

A *FeatureCollection* is composed by a number of *Features*. Each *Feature* has a *type* attribute with the **Feature** string value, a *geometry*   



The tool is useful to create GeoJSON files with a *property* attribute conforming a given specification.
The specification describes the attributes in the *property*
